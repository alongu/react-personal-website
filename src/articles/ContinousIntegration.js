//         Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team
//         integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - 
//         leading to multiple integrations per day. 
//         Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration
//         errors as quickly as possible. 
//         Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced 
//         integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. 
//         This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and 
//         its current usage.
