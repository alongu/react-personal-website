                I was the first intern to work with burning solar's small, brilliant team. 
                The team's core assignment was to develop a new photovoltaic technology based on carbon that has
                high efficiency at lower costs. 
                In the process we've performed many experiements with different carbon layers, which resulted with 
                a huge amount of data.
                My mission was to build a small sowtware based over matlab to analyze and create graphs from the data.
                This tool helped us to understand how should we change the experiemental parameters in a shorter time than before.
