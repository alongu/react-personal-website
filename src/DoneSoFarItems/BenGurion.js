            Ben-Gurion presented unprecedented scale and diversity of challanges. 
            My four years of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview.
            In Ben-Gurion I learned how to think, analyze and cope with large scale problems by myself.

            As an electrical engeenier student you are exposed to many disciplines from basic mathematics and physics, 
            through electromagnetic fields, semiconductors and image processing. 
            With an understanding of so many disciplines and a major in software, It feels that this experience gave me a lot 
            and helps me on a daily basis at work.
