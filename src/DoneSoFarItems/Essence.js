            As a C# backend developer at Essence, I had the opportunity to create simulators for the company's main product,   
            services, code libraries and UI tools.
            I was working with large rational databases and had to write stored procedures.
            The code and services I wrote pushed the company's R&D teams into a new testing environment, 
            and paved the way for the company's transient into automated testing and working with continues integration procedures.

            Working closely with professional backend and frontend developers opened my eyes for exciting new fields, 
            and paved my way into software engineering professionalism.
